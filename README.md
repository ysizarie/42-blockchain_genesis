# blockchain_genesis
In this project, I implemented my first blockchain system.
## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them
```
python3
pip3
#Some libraries:
Flask
pycrypto
requests
json
...

```
### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
Say what the step will be
```
#Installing pip package manager.
python get-pip.py
#Installing libraries with pip3
pip3 install <libname>
```
And repeat
```
until finished
```
## Running tests
After cloninig the repository and installing all additional software
```
cd /.../path_to_repo/
python3 node.py -p # -p means port, because my program uses webserver to work.
```
Go to the project folder and start it by using python3 interpreter with -p flag.
Then You can open it in your browser like > localhost:5000
